# How to contribute

I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to help this project come to fruition.

## Submitting changes


Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."


Thanks,
